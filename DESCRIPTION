Description: The package allows one to fit, online (or in a data stream) an multiple finite mixtures of logistic regression models. The main workhorse \code{online_log_mixture()} and its utility functions (such as \code{add_observation()} can be used to fit a model. The \code{multi_online_log_mixture} object allows one to fit multiple models in paralel and compare their outcomes.

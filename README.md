# ofmlr
R package for fitting online mixtures of logistic regression models.

To get things rolling in [R] use the following code:
```
library(devtools)	
install_github(“MKaptein/ofmlr”)
?ofmlr
```
and you should be ready to go. If the first line fails you will obviously have to install the devtools package first.

Let me know if there is anything unclear or not working!

#' Fit online finite mixtures of logistic regression models.
#'
#â€™ The ofmlr package allows one to fit, online (or in a data stream) multiple finite 
#' mixtures of logistic regression models in parallel. The main workhorse \code{online_log_mixture()} 
#' and its utility functions (such as \code{add_observation()} can be used to fit a model. 
#' The \code{multi_online_log_mixture} object allows one to fit multiple models in paralel
#' and compare their outcomes.
